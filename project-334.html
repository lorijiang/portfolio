                        <p>In this academic project, teams were tasked with designing a new app to address a target audience: seniors 75 years or older.</div>

                    <h2> It is difficult for older Chinese immigrants to find community. </h2>
                    <p> As important as community is in East Asian culture, many older Chinese immigrant adults struggle to form meaningful social interactions due to language barriers and cultural differences. </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4> Solution</h4>
                    <h2> An accessibly designed app for older Chinese immigrants to find culturally relevant events.</h2>
                        <p> 
                            Our team created an app focused on accessible design, that allows older Chinese immigrants to discover and participate in culturally relevant local events, in order build community through events that remind them of home. 
                        </p>

                </p>

                <p>While this was the map's main feature, we also retained positive aspects from the original map like the historical information, and resolved major usability issues to help user engagement.

                    <h2> User Research</h2>
                    <h3> Secondary Research and Personal Experience</h3>
                    <p> We started off researching potential problem spaces for adults aged 75 years and older more generally. What stood out was research supporting the growing epidemic of loneliness among older adults, and the impact it has on overall health.</p>
                    <!-- <li class="quote"> "Loneliness and social isolation are among the most potent determinants of health in old age" (Perissinotto, 2017) </li>

                    <h3 class="space-above"> Turning Point: Anecdotal Insights</h3> -->
                    <p> Drawing from our team's shared experience as second-generation Chinese immigrants living with our grandparents in Canada, I recognized the challenges they face from being separated from their communities back home. This inspired us to create an app to address their needs.
                    <!-- </p>
                    <p> Before jumping into this problem space, I did secondary research which validated the problem we saw. A study by Lai et al. in 2020 showed that in Canada, while "Chinese older immigrants represent one of the largest immigrant and ethnic minority groups, [...] they tend to have lower levels of acculturation and English proficiency, [and] greater vulnerability to social isolation." (Lai et al., 2020) </p>

                    <p> We decided that an event finding app to help connect older Chinese immigrants to local, culturally relevant activities and events would help strengthen their sense of community and lower their sense of loneliness. </p>

                            <p> A tap interaction is used to navigate through the pages rather than a scroll which could be difficult for older adults with hand dexterity issues. </p>

                            <h2> Cultural Events </h2>
                            <p> The events are curated towards cultural activities that older Chinese immigrants might miss from back home, including popular community-based activities like mahjong, taichi, or food markets. </p>

                            <p> It can be cumbersome to move in and out of the app to find directions, so we proposed a built-in map function to help decide whether the destination is accessible through walking or transit, as many do not drive. </p>

                            <li> Especially with older generations, many Chinese people believe that using red and certain patterns symbolizes luck. </li>
                            <li> Detailed information pages were designed to look like old Chinese flip calenders that older adults will likely have used in the past. </li>

                    <h2>What I learned</h2>
                        <p> One of the most significant learnings was the importance of designing with accessibility in mind. Incorporating larger font sizes, high contrast colors, and intuitive navigation features not only enhances user experience but also ensures inclusivity for all users, especially those with diverse needs.</p>
                    <h2>Things that can be improved</h2>
                    <p> Due to time and resources constraints, we placed more importance on creating accessible and culturally aware designs than on having elegant visual design, so if I were to continue this project the next steps would be elevating the visual design. </p>
